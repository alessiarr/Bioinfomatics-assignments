The assignment has been developed in two modules, the first calculates the frequences of each dimer over the CpG island sequences 
and non-CpG island sequences of chromosome 22. Results are stored in txt files that can be used in the second module to produce the two models.
The two python files must be stored in a folder containing the fasta file of chromosome 22 and the txt file containing the details of the CpG islands over the genome 
(are the two files that are also shown in the slides, I used the links there to download them).
In order, first run the 'FrequencesForModels.py' and then the 'ModelCpGIsland.py'; the models are checked using three sequences:
a CpG island randomly selected from chr 22 (step done in the first python file and stored in a txt file), a sequence randomly selected from chr 22 that is likely not a 
CpG island and a randomly generated sequence.
