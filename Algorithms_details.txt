NEEDLEMAN & WUNSCH ALGORITHM: both the filled matrix, the score and the alignment are visualized.
Inputs must be provided in the terminal together with the file name (sys strategy was employes); the inputs must be written in the following order
1. file name
2. string 1
3. string 2
4. match score
5. mismatch score
6. gap score

SMITH & WATERMAN ALGORITHM: as for the N&W, will be dispayed both the matrix, the score and the local alignment
The algorithm was implemented in such a way that the traceback stops when all 3 neighbors are 0
OR
none of the neighbors could have produced that value (it is the case of some zeros, where their true value should actually be negative)
	--> THEREFORE, if some neighbor could have generated the zero, the alignment continues, otherwise it stops
Inputs must be provided in the terminal together with the file name (sys strategy was employed); the inputs must be written in the following order
1. file name
2. string 1
3. string 2
4. match score
5. mismatch score
6. gap score
