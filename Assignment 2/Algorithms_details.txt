The file 'ShortestCommonString.py' contains the Python code for the greedy algorithm, where the prefix-suffix overlap has
to be of at least three characters to be taken into accoutnt. At the end of the code there are some lines both to test the algorithm 
and to compare the result with the Brute Force approach (see line 4, the methods have been imported)
The file 'BruteForceSCS.py', instead, contains the Brute Force algorithm.
Both algorithms can be tested both with a random generation (methods 'getGenome' and 'getSubstrings') and with the strings used 
in the slides as example (which are {'ATCGGA','TACCCA', 'AGCTAC', 'CGGATT', 'TTGCTA'}).
